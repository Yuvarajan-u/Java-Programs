Package name should be unique.

Package name should be mirror of your domain
for example:
domain: google.com
package name: com.google

No one should use our package name 

If we are having a package like:   com.yuva.test

Now i need to access all class files in test folder

so i should use like com.yuva.test.*; -> it will fetch all classes from test class

It will not go inside folders it can access only files

if we need we need to be clear while importing
