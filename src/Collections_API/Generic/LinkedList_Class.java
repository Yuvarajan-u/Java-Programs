/*

Both are implementation of List Interface.

ArrayList -> dynamic Array -> 
if we are adding an element between we have to update all the elements 

index number which is coming after that number. it is 'time consuming'. vice versa for removing.

for fetching the element from list array list has index numbers so it will faster than linked list in 
searching

LinkedList -> doubly linked list
It will store element in node with has previous node address and next node address 

so if we are adding an element in between somewhere in a list it will affect the previous and next node
we have to update their addresses only node before and after will not affect. so it will save time
Linked list is faster than Array List.

it is difficult to search in linked list compared to this array list will fetch very fast.
